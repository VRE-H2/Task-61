        <h2>About Task 61</h2>
        <p>
          The primary objective of Task 61 (VRE-H2) is to advance the energy transition by examining the production of clean hydrogen from wind and solar resources, termed Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) sources. This task is a collaborative effort between three IEA TCPs: Wind, Photovoltaic Power Systems (PVPS), and Hydrogen. The proposed multi-disciplinary and multi-technology collaboration will enable a more efficient and comprehensive approach to the interdisciplinary nature of this challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scope of this initiative encompasses a wide array of technologies, with a primary concentration on the design and operation of VRE-hydrogen plants. The intended outcome is to compile ongoing research findings and industry best practices, creating a comprehensive overview of VRE-hydrogen plant design, operation, and regulation. The task aims to answer three of the central open series of questions surrounding the development and deployment of VRE-hydrogen plants:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the capabilities and needs of each technology component of a VRE-hydrogen plant and how can they be integrated effectively and efficiently?</li>
          <li>What are the needed Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) measures and recommended practices for VRE-hydrogen plant integration?</li>
          <li>What are the environmental and social ramifications of combining wind and solar for hydrogen production on a large scale?</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Work Package 2 (WP2) – VRE-hydrogen plant use case development and reference designs</h3>
          <p>
            In this work package an overview will be generated of the wind, solar and hydrogen components for VRE-hydrogen plants and reference VRE-hydrogen plants will be designed to perform in specific conditions and sites, such as onshore, offshore fixed and offshore floating configurations.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-package">
          <h3>Work Package 3 (WP3) – Recommended practices for VRE-hydrogen integration</h3>
          <p>
            This work package is concerned with the recommended practices for VRE-hydrogen regulation and standards. The work package will be organized around categorizing the different integration needs of each technology and providing a set of standard recommendations for standards and regulation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="work-package">
          <h3>Work Package 4 (WP4) – Environmental impacts and public perception of VRE-hydrogen</h3>
          <p>
            This work package is concerned with the environmental impacts and public perception of VRE-hydrogen integration for VRE-hydrogen production. The work package will be organized characterizing different environmental studies and impacts in each technology area to create a combined body of work, as well as collecting any cross-disciplinary work that has been done in this area.
